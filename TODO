Outstanding issues:

* xs:any constructs are not yet supported. These are spread throughout the schema
  and are critical to some areas such as <assert> and <itemSet>. These will have
  limited usefulness until xs:any is implemented.

* enumerations are not yet supported. This only affects two places in the NewsML-G2
  schema: 'dir' (ltr|rtl) and 'videoscan' (progressive|interlaced)

* Remote catalog loading over HTTP is not yet supported.
